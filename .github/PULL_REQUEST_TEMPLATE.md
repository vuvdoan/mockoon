<!--
IMPORTANT RULES:
- Read the contributing guidelines first!
- All pull requests must stem from an issue. No issue, no PR review, no merge.
- Implementation, UI, UX, needs to be discussed either in the issue, or in the PR before starting the development.
- Commits should be squashed to a single commit, or more if relevant. They should follow this guide https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ and contain the following mention: `Closes #{issue_number}`.
- Follow the branch naming convention: feature|fix/{issue_number}-description.
- Follow the template!
